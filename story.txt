Deep in the forest, there once was a squirrel named Benedict.
Benedict was a happy squirrel except for one thing that bugged him.
That bastard Larry in the tree next to his!
Larry was a major league asshole and was constantly hitting on Benedicts girlfriend.
Benedict could not abide, so he decided to set a trap for that tool Larry.
He tied up an anvil over Larry's front door in order to teach him a lesson.
